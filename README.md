## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

**This is Jep-T's repository :-)

- I'm writing my bachelors degree in economics this semester in the field of econometrics.
- I'm here for my macroeconomic analysis clases though...
- I like playing football, and I love the summer break more than anything in the world (I think).
- I despise Real Madrid and maybe even more Manchester United. I'm not sure, as you don't have to despise Manchester United that much, they are so bad by default you should almost feel bad instead.
